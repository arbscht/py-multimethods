Information about py-multimethods:

multimethods.py provides a simplistic implementation of Clojure-like
multimethods for Python 2.4 or later.

Included classes:
  * Multimethod: instantiates to an object to which
    implementing methods belong.  Methods are added via the
    static Multimethod.add() decorator.  Methods can be removed
    or prioritized using Multimethod.remove() and Multimethod.prefer()
    respectively.

  * NoMatchingMethodError: thrown when there is no implementing
    method found for a call with some given arguments.  This implies
    that no default method was added.

Methods can only be defined at the top level global namespace.

See tests.py for an example of usage.
